# üìäSupply Chain ESG Risk Analysis

## Project Objective
Analyze supplier risk using ESG scores, geopolitical risk, and supply chain data to identify high-risk suppliers and sectors.

## [Data sets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15TpAQFVULgdmsL5SiO0QZa2RVfFbuz9M?usp=sharing)

The goal is to:
- Identify high-risk suppliers.
- Analyze sector-level risk exposure.
- Build a machine learning model to predict supplier risk.
- Create a Power BI dashboard for interactive insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
## Supply Chain Data (Synthetic):
- Supplier transactions (lead time, revenue, availability, stock levels).
- Manufacturing & logistics details (production volumes, transport modes, shipping costs).
- Quality control (inspection results, defect rates, delivery reliability).
## ESG Data (Downloaded):
- Environmental, Social, Governance risk scores.
- Sub-scores: Environment, Social, Governance.
- Controversy level & ESG risk percentile.
## Geopolitical Data:
- Global Political Risk Index per supplier region.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

- Removed missing & duplicate values.

- Standardized supplier IDs across all datasets.

- Merged supply chain, ESG, and geopolitical datasets.

- Created a final master dataset with 60+ features per supplier.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Sector Analysis:

- Energy sector had the highest lead times and highest ESG risk scores.

- Manufacturing sector showed moderate risk but better delivery reliability.

## Correlation Insights:

- Higher ESG risk scores often correlated with longer lead times.

- High geopolitical risk regions had more supplier delays.

## Risk Distribution:

- Majority of suppliers were low-to-medium risk.

- High-risk suppliers concentrated in specific sectors and regions.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

- Created Avg_Risk_Prob (predicted probability of risk).

- Encoded categorical variables (sector, supplier flag).

- Normalized ESG & geopolitical scores.

- Aggregated supplier-level features:

  Average risk probability.

  Maximum observed risk probability.

  Revenue contribution & transactions count.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model

- Target: Supplier_Risk_Flag (0 = Low/Medium Risk, 1 = High Risk).

- Models Tested:  Random Forest for final Deployment due ti high ROC-AOC(0.89) and balanced Precision/Recall

- Performance Metrics:

   Precision, Recall, F1-score for imbalanced target.

  ROC-AUC to measure discriminatory power.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizations (Power BI Dashboard)

## üìä Key Insights

- Energy sector suppliers show highest ESG risk and longest lead times ‚Üí operational bottleneck.

- High geopolitical index regions are prone to supply chain disruptions.

- Revenue is concentrated in medium-risk suppliers, highlighting the importance of managing them effectively.

- Strong correlation between ESG risk and delivery delays.
